 # TrelloToKrogerAisle
A Python script to grab cards from a Trello grocery list, check your local Kroger location for stock, and then re-upload the cards with aisle numbers sorted ascending

***HOW TO SETUP*** <br>
Register for a Trello and Kroger Developer account and get the necessary API keys and tokens.
Put said API info into Kroger_v2_Distribution_Copy.py.
Place the Flask_WebServer.py file on a server with Python (I recommend PythonAnywhere it's free).
In the folder with the Flask server make a folder called scripts and place the Kroger_v2_Distribution_Copy.py file in it.
In the scripts folder make a folder called variables and add a json file named varaibles.json
On a website hosting server place the entire simplygrocery folder in it.
Enjoy and feel free to add an issue if you have any questions!
